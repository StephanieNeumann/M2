      The whole Christmas <span id="rime">season!</span><br>
      Now, please don’t ask why. <br>
      No one quite knows the <span id="secondRime">reason.</span><br>
      It could be that his head wasn’t screwed on <span id="quite"></span>quite</span> <span id="right"></span>right.</span><br>
      It could be perhaps that his shoes were too <span id="tight"></span>tight.</span><br>
      But I think that the most likely reason of all<br>
      May have been that his heart was two sizes too small<br>
