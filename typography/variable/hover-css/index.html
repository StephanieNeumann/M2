    <p id="textlol">The Grinch hated Christmas! <br><br>
      The whole Christmas <span id="rime">season!</span><br><br>
      Now, please don’t ask why. <br><br>
      No one quite knows the <span id="secondRime">reason.</span><br><br>
      It could be that his <span id=head>head</span> wasn’t screwed on <span id="quite">quite</span> <span id="right">right.</span><br><br>
      It could be perhaps that his shoes were too <span id="tight">tight.</span><br><br>
      But I think that the most likely reason of <span id='all'>all</span><br><br>
      May have been that his <span id="heart">heart</span> was two sizes too <span id='small'>small</span><br><br>
